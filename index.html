					<br>All professions require work or industry experience in some capacity.
					 Development jobs require more skills in programming languages, 
					 whereas Cyber Security involves working with clients. 
					 Nearly all jobs require at least a bachelor’s degree, 
					 however data engineering requires further tertiary study into a masters or doctorate. 
					 The job growth for cyber security, data engineer, 
					 full stack development and software development have roughly 20% job growth, 
					 whereas game development has around 9%.  (SEEK Career Advice, 2020)

IT Job Ranking in terms of demand 2017 – 2018, as gathered by Burning Glass: <br>
1.	Graphic Designer with a whopping total of 887 active selections<br>
2.	Full Stack developer with a total of 344 active selections<br>
3.	Software developer coming in close with 337 <br>
4.	Data Engineer with 182  <br>
5.	Cyber security analysts – 173<br>
6.	C++ Developer – 44<br><br>
However, by early 2019 to 2020, as technology developed, specific job demands also changed:<br>
1.	Cyber security positions took the lead, due to the growing need of security for consumers and clients interconnected within the IOT (Internet of Things)<br>
2.	Data engineer jobs are also in demand in Australia, as of recently due to the current pandemic, they have been a spike overall for IT jobs in the industry, and the need for engineers have increased. <br>
3.	Full stack development, as many companies are straying away from specific “front end or back end” (McKinley,2019) positions, and now require individuals that can perform at all levels of application stacks. <br>
4.	Software Developer, More and more businesses require the help of software developers to create specialised programs and software both for mobile, web and other purposes, which assists in maintaining their competitive edge in the market. This proves to be true as currently in Australia there are more then 5000 wanted job listings on Seek.<br>
5.	Game developer/Graphic designer jobs are also rising, with a total of 1072 job listings on Seek (Seek,2020), posted within the past couple months. This is a result of the growing popularity of esports and technology such as AR and VR. The total income generated from game development studios within the past year, comes to a total of $143.5 million alone.<br>
<br>
Skill Ranking in terms of demand, 2017 to 2018:<br>

		<h3>Opinion about Ideal Job</h3>

<p>
Jack<br>
My opinion of my ideal job has not changed because based on the data, the game industry is growing and the skills required are something I am currently learning or something I am planning on learning in the near future. Java, C# and C++ are skills I am learning and intent on learning and the data suggests that game design and development is a growing field with the advancement in Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality technologies as well as the increase in popularity of eSports and gaming in general.<br>
<br>
Renelo<br>
After taking a look at the Burning Glass data in terms of the IT field of cybersecurity, my opinions on the career bracket of the cybersecurity world hasn't really changed a bit. Even though cybersecurity ranked second-to-last on the 'IT Job Ranking in terms of demand' from 2017-2018, I feel like its ranking score of 173 is only going to increase in the future. In conclusion, I believe that looking at the Burning Glass data is only really a good indicator of how a specific job is doing at the moment, rather than taking the long-term into account.<br>
<br>
Nush<br>
Previously my ideal job was software developer and after looking at the Burning glass data, I would still like to stick with this job as there will be demand for this job even in the near future. I would also like to acquire skills about robotic and automation as I am newly finding interest on that subject. Thus, my ideal job is still software developer but having the skills about robotics and automation will further help build up my career as robots will be present in our daily life soon in the future. <br>

					 <br> IT Work</h2>
				<p>
					IT WORK Questions: <br>

1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?<br>
My job title is IT support Engineer, Primarily I do first and second line IT support work. Its a lot of break fix sort of stuff. If somebody can’t log into there laptop because of a password issue they will call me or my team. I also do a lot of User Administration when we have somebody new starting at the company, I will set up all of there IT accounts and set up their laptop for them. That use to be done in person now I will mail them out a laptop and everything will be done remotely. Mostly I fix problems as they come up I also do a bit of project work as well. <br>
<br>
2. Please tell us about the industry you work in. <br>
I work in the financial industry, for a Superfund. <br><br>
3. What other kinds of work do you have to do? <br>
Along with the support work I do, I do a bit of ad hoc project work occasionally and help the infrastructure team. Right now, I doing a project building new line for the service desk currently I we use AWS which is quite expensive. But we pay for Zoom for our video chat now I’m seeing if we can use Zoom Phone as an alternative for the IT desk line. <br>
<br>
4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them. <br>
Being first line support, I am the first contact for anybody who has a service request or incident. I interact with everybody in the business. That could be anybody from any department. It could be a call centre worker all the way up to the CEO I also deal with external vendors quite often
To take it back to the project I mentioned before I have been talking to zoom about the capability of there product and if it fits out use case. That’s a very broad answer but its support for the business so that could really be anybody in the business be that externally on internally. Crucially I don’t have to speak to customers, the super companies’ members. <br>
<br>
5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals. <br>
Being the first point of contact regardless of how a ticket comes through. It will go to myself or another person in my role. Will pass on these requests to another IT professional. I regular speak to the infrastructure team who work very closely with us. But to a lesser extent I speak to developers and solutions architects in other parts of the business who are doing their own thing. <br>
<br>
6. What about your interactions with clients or investors? <br>
I don’t have to speak to with any superfund members or investors in my role. <br>
<br>
7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these. <br>
What I spend the most time does vary a bit. Generally, I would say most of my work consist of dealing with Service requests and incidents. Service request being I want access to something, or I want a new piece of hardware. Incident being, something a staff member has it broken, be it a monitor or laptop whatever.
Most of my day I will be logged into the phones and I will also get email contacts. We also have an IT support portal where people log their incidents and requests into. <br>
<br>
8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging? <br>
I need to have a very broad knowledge base. Quite often people will approach me with a question about an application that I have never heard of. When this happens, I first need to check the documentation we have on the application. Around half of the time I find we don’t have the documentation we need. When there is no documentation, I start by asking my team if they heard of the application then I have to start reach out to a lot of different people across different parts of the business.
Probably the most channelling part is lack of information, when I need to know a lot about a lot of different stuff. <br>
<br>
9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry? <br>
This is going to sound like a response you would give in a job interview. But I feel like the essence of the IT industry Is facilitating businesses allowing them to do what they better. I can give you some examples of how this works into my job.
If somebody is locked out of there computer, they can’t do their job. By me or one of my team members being available to unlock their computer they can do the job they are being paid to do.
Another example if we handed a developer with a laptop with 4gb of ram. They wouldn’t have the tools they needed to do their job. My job is to facilitate the most reasonable accommodation. A laptop with 4gb of ram is just an example, we don’t have those. But everybody always wants the best available technology to work with. But that’s very expensive and you need to cut a line between what people want and what can be provided. <br>

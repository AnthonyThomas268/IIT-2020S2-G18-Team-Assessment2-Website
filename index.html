IT Job Ranking in terms of demand 2017 – 2018, as gathered by Burning Glass: <br>
1.	Graphic Designer with a whopping total of 887 active selections<br>
2.	Full Stack developer with a total of 344 active selections<br>
3.	Software developer coming in close with 337 <br>
4.	Data Engineer with 182  <br>
5.	Cyber security analysts – 173<br>
6.	C++ Developer – 44<br><br>
However, by early 2019 to 2020, as technology developed, specific job demands also changed:<br>
1.	Cyber security positions took the lead, due to the growing need of security for consumers and clients interconnected within the IOT (Internet of Things)<br>
2.	Data engineer jobs are also in demand in Australia, as of recently due to the current pandemic, they have been a spike overall for IT jobs in the industry, and the need for engineers have increased. <br>
3.	Full stack development, as many companies are straying away from specific “front end or back end” (McKinley,2019) positions, and now require individuals that can perform at all levels of application stacks. <br>
4.	Software Developer, More and more businesses require the help of software developers to create specialised programs and software both for mobile, web and other purposes, which assists in maintaining their competitive edge in the market. This proves to be true as currently in Australia there are more then 5000 wanted job listings on Seek.<br>
5.	Game developer/Graphic designer jobs are also rising, with a total of 1072 job listings on Seek (Seek,2020), posted within the past couple months. This is a result of the growing popularity of esports and technology such as AR and VR. The total income generated from game development studios within the past year, comes to a total of $143.5 million alone.<br>

		<h3>Opinion about Ideal Job</h3>

<p>
Jack<br>
My opinion of my ideal job has not changed because based on the data, the game industry is growing and the skills required are something I am currently learning or something I am planning on learning in the near future. Java, C# and C++ are skills I am learning and intent on learning and the data suggests that game design and development is a growing field with the advancement in Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality technologies as well as the increase in popularity of eSports and gaming in general.<br>
<br>
Renelo<br>
After taking a look at the Burning Glass data in terms of the IT field of cybersecurity, my opinions on the career bracket of the cybersecurity world hasn't really changed a bit. Even though cybersecurity ranked second-to-last on the 'IT Job Ranking in terms of demand' from 2017-2018, I feel like its ranking score of 173 is only going to increase in the future. In conclusion, I believe that looking at the Burning Glass data is only really a good indicator of how a specific job is doing at the moment, rather than taking the long-term into account.<br>
<br>
Nush<br>
Previously my ideal job was software developer and after looking at the Burning glass data, I would still like to stick with this job as there will be demand for this job even in the near future. I would also like to acquire skills about robotic and automation as I am newly finding interest on that subject. Thus, my ideal job is still software developer but having the skills about robotics and automation will further help build up my career as robots will be present in our daily life soon in the future. <br>

					 <br> IT Work</h2>
				<p>
					IT WORK Questions: <br>

1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?<br>
My job title is IT support Engineer, Primarily I do first and second line IT support work. Its a lot of break fix sort of stuff. If somebody can’t log into there laptop because of a password issue they will call me or my team. I also do a lot of User Administration when we have somebody new starting at the company, I will set up all of there IT accounts and set up their laptop for them. That use to be done in person now I will mail them out a laptop and everything will be done remotely. Mostly I fix problems as they come up I also do a bit of project work as well. <br>
<br>
2. Please tell us about the industry you work in. <br>
I work in the financial industry, for a Superfund. <br><br>
3. What other kinds of work do you have to do? <br>
Along with the support work I do, I do a bit of ad hoc project work occasionally and help the infrastructure team. Right now, I doing a project building new line for the service desk currently I we use AWS which is quite expensive. But we pay for Zoom for our video chat now I’m seeing if we can use Zoom Phone as an alternative for the IT desk line. <br>
<br>
4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them. <br>
Being first line support, I am the first contact for anybody who has a service request or incident. I interact with everybody in the business. That could be anybody from any department. It could be a call centre worker all the way up to the CEO I also deal with external vendors quite often
To take it back to the project I mentioned before I have been talking to zoom about the capability of there product and if it fits out use case. That’s a very broad answer but its support for the business so that could really be anybody in the business be that externally on internally. Crucially I don’t have to speak to customers, the super companies’ members. <br>
<br>
5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals. <br>
Being the first point of contact regardless of how a ticket comes through. It will go to myself or another person in my role. Will pass on these requests to another IT professional. I regular speak to the infrastructure team who work very closely with us. But to a lesser extent I speak to developers and solutions architects in other parts of the business who are doing their own thing. <br>
<br>
6. What about your interactions with clients or investors? <br>
I don’t have to speak to with any superfund members or investors in my role. <br>
<br>
7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these. <br>
What I spend the most time does vary a bit. Generally, I would say most of my work consist of dealing with Service requests and incidents. Service request being I want access to something, or I want a new piece of hardware. Incident being, something a staff member has it broken, be it a monitor or laptop whatever.
Most of my day I will be logged into the phones and I will also get email contacts. We also have an IT support portal where people log their incidents and requests into. <br>
<br>
8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging? <br>
I need to have a very broad knowledge base. Quite often people will approach me with a question about an application that I have never heard of. When this happens, I first need to check the documentation we have on the application. Around half of the time I find we don’t have the documentation we need. When there is no documentation, I start by asking my team if they heard of the application then I have to start reach out to a lot of different people across different parts of the business.
Probably the most channelling part is lack of information, when I need to know a lot about a lot of different stuff. <br>
<br>
9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry? <br>
This is going to sound like a response you would give in a job interview. But I feel like the essence of the IT industry Is facilitating businesses allowing them to do what they better. I can give you some examples of how this works into my job.
If somebody is locked out of there computer, they can’t do their job. By me or one of my team members being available to unlock their computer they can do the job they are being paid to do.
Another example if we handed a developer with a laptop with 4gb of ram. They wouldn’t have the tools they needed to do their job. My job is to facilitate the most reasonable accommodation. A laptop with 4gb of ram is just an example, we don’t have those. But everybody always wants the best available technology to work with. But that’s very expensive and you need to cut a line between what people want and what can be provided. <br>

		 <div id="project">
			 <h1>Overview</h1>
			 <p>The project will consist of creating a food control AI, that will monitor, and track food stored in the fridge and pantry. The application will be set up over the surface of the fridge and pantry door. It will analyze the food present inside and moreover; it can detect those foods which are close to their expiration date or foods which have gone rotten. In case where the food has gone rotten, it can send emergency alerts to the owners’ phone or other devises to remove those from the space. So, we can see it will be connected to the owner’s phones or other devices. Over time it adapts to the food choices and frequent buys. Then it automatically replenishes by contacting the nearest grocery and ordering the items. It is obvious that people might not want the same food or products again. That is why the fridge will send an alert or notification to the user’s phone stating the grocery list and from that list they can exclude items that they do not want and also has an option to add new stuff as well. So, when the user confirms the purchase, the application can automatically order from the grocery store about the list of items. If the consumer wants and has a favorite grocery store, then they can become a member, so that they can get their desired items. The AI is self-adaptive, and highly intelligent, it will be stored within the fridge and the pantry, equipped with a camera to monitor the stock.  
				 <br><br><br>			 
			 </p>
			 <h2>Motivation</h2>
			 <p>The objective of this project is to expand on current smart fridge technologies and further integrate their use into home automation systems and subscription services. It would aim to reduce food spoilage and wastage, help people manage calorie intake, and reduce the time an individual would need to spend shopping.  
			<br><br>
			 </p>
			 <h3>Reduce Food wastage:</h3>
			 <p>Globally, a third of all fresh produce, such as fruits, dairy and meat, is lost to waste, costing the global economy approximately 990 billion dollars a year (Food and Agriculture organization of the United Nations, 2020). In Australia, 34% of total food waste is from households (ARCADIS, 2019), with the most common cause being produce spoiling when left too long in a fridge or freezer, followed by people not finishing meals (Surprising Facts about Food Waste, 2020).  
				 <br>
				 The AI that would be introduced into a smart fridge would help minimize this wastage by ensuring the quantities of food being ordered are suitable for the number of members in any given household, as well as sending alerts whenever food was about to spoil.  
                  <br>
			 </p>
			 <h4>Help people manage Caloric Intake </h4>
			 <p>
				Currently, 67 percent of Australian adults are considered overweight or obese. (Department of Health | Overweight and Obesity, 2020). One of aims of the smart fridge AI is help people more effectively manage their daily intake, and therefore reduce overall obesity rates, by suggesting meal plans, and reducing people over-ordering on their weekly shop.  
			 </p>
			 <h5>Reduce Shopping Time:</h5>
			 <p>
				The average person will shop for food 1.6 times a week and spend approximately 43 minutes per shopping trip. Annually, that equates to around 56 hours. (Save time by becoming a smarter grocery shopper - ABC Life, 2020) If an individual shops every week of their life, between the ages of 18 and 75, that is 3100 hours (129 days) over their lifetime, which is an immense amount of time to be dedicated to a single task. 
				 <br>
				 The smart fridge system would monitor food consumption, and order foods that are regularly eaten to be delivered to the home instead, which would greatly reduce the overall time people spent shopping for food each year, and this lost time could be spent more productively elsewhere. <br><br><br>
			 </p>
			 <h2>Description</h2>
			 <p>The food control AI (Artificial Intelligence) will consist of nested AI components within a powerful minicomputer. Included with this will be a mounted camera. The food control AI will be installed within the fridge and pantry and will use its equipped camera to monitor and record the products stored within. The images captured will be backed up daily to the cloud, where it can be accessed via an app that can be downloaded onto any personal device. This memory feature is vital to the AI’s learning and recognition, and it contributes to its self-adaptive trait. This also provides the individual with an overview of current food stock in their homes. 
				 <br>Over time, the food control AI will adapt to the individual’s buying habits, involving the most frequent replenished products, their highest quantity of specific products, and their most used items. This will allow for a feature that enables the AI to recognize when a specific product is about to finish, and automatically create a virtual shopping cart of the required products which will be recommended (through notifications to the owner) to be purchased. The individual then will have the option to do one-off setup of their preferred local grocery store, delivery details (address, etc.), and payment method. The food control AI will then automatically purchase the required goods based on the set options. This feature is completely optional and can be turned off at any time without any hassles, keeping the authority of control with the user. If the user feels uncomfortable with relying on an AI to automatically order groceries based of its self-learning, and neither has the time to manually tell the AI to order the items when required. There will be an option to set up a roster which consists of establishing a set day and time each week, that the AI will be allowed to order the required the products. 
				 The individual will have full control of the food control AI from within the handy dandy app provided, which will contain the following features: 
				 <br><br>
				 •	Able to turn the food control AI on and off at any time <br>
                 •	Set backup timings for the images to be uploaded to the server, and the option to manually backup these images to the device local storage <br>
                •	The ability to manage and delete all information captured by the machine <br>
                •	The ability to setup “sleep times” where the AI will turn off all recording capabilities and proceed to hibernate for those certain time frames <br><br>
                All in all, the individual will have full admin access to all features of the program, thereby upholding their safety and security. <br><br><br>
				</p>
				<h2>Tools + Tech</h2>
				<p>•	Establishing a safe and secure cloud server <br> 
					•	Acquiring high processing powered computers with access to the internet <br>
					•	Ensuring there is enough electricity to power up the system <br>
					•	Acquiring computers with abundant RAM and storage <br><br><br>				 
					</p>
				<h2>Skills</h2>
				<p>•	individuals with knowledge and experience of programming languages; JAVA, C++, Python <br>
					•	Knowledge and experience in AI algorithms and development <br>
					•	Knowledge and experience in machine learning <br>
					•	Able to work cooperatively in a team-based environment <br>
					•	Experience in UI development <br>
					•	Experience in graphic programming <br>
					•	Any other related skills and knowledge in the IT field are gladly welcomed <br>	<br><br>
					</p>
				<h2>Outcome</h2>
				<p>If this project is to be successful in the end, then the outcome will consist of happy families who will have this food control AI fridge and pantry installed into their kitchen spacing of their household. This project idea will ultimately solve the problem of many households and families wasting thousands, upon thousands of food/consumables every year. This development will have a big impact on society, as this will mean that less food and consumables will be wasted, leading to money being saved for families across Australia, and eventually the globe! <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> </p>
